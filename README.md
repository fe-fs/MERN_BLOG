Hello! This little application Blog was developed as a study of the full stack MERN process, 
Connecting a react front page with the backend using the database MongoDB (online and local testing).

I learned about express | cors | morgan | axios | mongoDB | react working together.

After that I learned how to heroku worked to deploy this application and connect it together with my main branch inside github. So each time I make a change and push to my repo it will auto deploy again those changes in heroku.
